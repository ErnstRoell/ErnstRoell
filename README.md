### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Repositories! 
I am a second year PhD student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) 
working on machine learning. Our lab leverages topology and abstract 
mathematics to enhance current machine learning methods.

My research interests are the application of so-called Euler Characteristic 
transforms in machine learning. They provide a summary of shapes with
advantageous properties and we hope to leverage this to find better 
algorithms to do shape classification and reconstruction.
